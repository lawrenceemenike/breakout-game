# Breakout Game

This is a simple Breakout game implemented using Python's `turtle` module. The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game ends when the player misses the ball three times, and the ball speed increases gradually over time.

## Features

- Control the paddle using the left and right arrow keys.
- Break bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.
- Score points for each brick broken.
- The game ends after three misses.
- The ball speed increases gradually over time.
- The game restarts automatically after a game over or when all bricks are broken.
